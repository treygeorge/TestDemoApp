#Other Ideas#
* Coding a clock - https://coderwall.com/p/gnjg_w

* string.repeatify() - implement this.  Tests that they know to String.prototype.repeatify = function() {}

* define a log() that will act as a proxy to console.log().  I should be able to pass any number of args into the function and have them all show up in console.log()
	function log(){
		console.log.apply(console, arguments);
	};  //this tests .apply() and arguments
